# TypingSpeedTest
I have a created a typing test web app which generates a random test sentence(using API https://api.quotable.io/) which the user has to type in the provided text area. The characters entered correctly are turned into green colour and wrong ones are turned into red. It also shows a countdown timer of 60 sec and counter for number of mistakes.

This project is developed using HTML,CSS,Javascript and Microsoft Azure Static Web app service for deployment.
